Signatures in their guest book include many European and American names of note, but the diary chronicling a long-term project where they invited British servicemen from a barracks in Gibraltar to stay with them every weekend, mentioned only one Moroccan name, that of a domestic worker, and not always in the kindest of terms. Towards the end of the manuscript the diary recounts a shocking, racially charged incident that doesn’t paint Jim Ede in the best of lights.</p>"},"id":"c2f77c83-c630-47bb-9e6b-9e8e049f1a4c","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"image":["file://qJYjqv7bZnVg2uIe"]},"id":"860c3b7b-f051-49ac-a0fe-9c1a67bf5f3d","isHidden":false,"type":"image"},{"content":{"text":"<p>As part of my research I wanted to familiarise myself with Cambridge, so I walked around Kettle’s Yard and was struck by bright magenta flowers in the church yard next door.

Curator, Guy Haywood, told me that there was a painting hung in the downstairs extension by Winifred Nicholson titled ‘Cyclamen and Primula’ (1923), and that Jim had been gifted the flower by Winifred, planted it in the garden and it had likely self-seeded in the church yard.</p>"},"id":"9be689b5-2bb4-4a17-9c10-d9ec6b9d3baf","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"image":["file://dcyCEaMNDS0WZvb1"]},"id":"9f7cda4b-50f9-4aa1-a47b-adaa8cbd008e","isHidden":false,"type":"image"},{"content":{"text":"<p>The flower for me, became a symbol of Jim and Helen Ede’s friendship with Winifred and Ben Nicholson, and the painting told that story.

Together we curated a screening which we titled ‘<em>The Daghour was always in Bloom’</em>, after a sequence from Abdessamad El Montassir’s (2021) video ‘<em>Galb’Echaouf</em> ‘.

Partnerreflection: [{"content":{"text":"<p>Kettle’s Yard</p><p>20/20 artist Adham Faramawy undertook a residency with Kettle’s Yard, University of Cambridge, which enabled important discussions around the origins of Kettle’s Yard and time spent by its founders Jim and Helen Ede in colonial North Africa, where they lived from 1936 until 1952. The residency led to the creation of a new film that was screened at Kettle’s Yard in November 2024 and will become part of Kettle’s Yard’s collection.</p><p>Prior to opening their house in Cambridge to students and the wider public in 1957, the Edes built and lived in a house in Tangier, Morocco, where they hosted members of the British Armed Forces who were stationed in Gibraltar. As an artist of North African descent, Faramawy wanted to understand more about the Edes’ role in a country that was, at that time, under colonial rule. Faramawy carried out research in Kettle’s Yard’s archive, looking at various material including Jim Ede’s papers, writings and diaries, and met with members of staff across the team to gather stories and knowledge. Through this research, they discovered a problematic relationship between Jim Ede and local people in Tangier, partly documented in a racist account of an incident in Tangier in Ede’s writings. This research went on to inform Faramawy’s project and was discussed within the institution and shared with audiences through public events.</p><p>Faramawy also looked at objects and furniture in the collection, noting the absence of any artworks by North African artists and of any publicly accessible information about North African objects or items of furniture – detecting what they described as a racialised hierarchy, when it comes to the display and interpretation of objects in the house. They also investigated the role of non-indigenous plants and flowers at Kettle’s Yard, in its garden and floral displays in the house. Faramawy worked towards writing a script, before collaborating with two dancers to create a film that was shot in the Kettle’s Yard house and at the Cambridge University Botanic Garden.</p><p>Faramawy’s film will be the first moving image work to become part of Kettle’s Yard’s collection. The acquisition process has provided an opportunity for curators to develop institutional knowledge and procedures around collecting and conserving moving image work and has enabled collaboration with other institutions and experts.</p><p>Participation in 20/20 is part of a wider programme of work at Kettle’s Yard through which we are committed to commissioning and sharing research, projects and programmes that explore colonial contexts at Kettle’s Yard and deepen our understanding and knowledge of the house and collection. Kettle’s Yard has a long history of working with artists to engage with and respond to the house, collection and archive, and we will continue to create opportunities for artists through participating in essential commissioning projects like 20/20.</p>"},"id":"d29a17b8-dd65-4d59-aae4-1f30de5b7609","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
