Alt: Two people are seated on the floor in a bright room, performing a synchronised dance-like movement with their arms stretched upwards. One wears a blue outfit and the other a burnt-orange one. The room features a round table, chairs, and a large window with white blinds. The subtitle reads â€˜and she wasted away from loneliness'
