Alt: Collaged onto a black-and-white image of a bicycle shop are a golden silhouette and a series of painted black figures. On the right side, a line drawing of a young girl is visible. A colour photograph of two young women, along with a cut-out vintage postcard of a street scene, appears next to black circular shapes and lines.
