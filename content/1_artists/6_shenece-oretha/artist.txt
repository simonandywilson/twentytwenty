Partnerreflection: [{"content":{"text":"<p>As the Hepworth Wakefield, we acknowledge the significant impact\r\nof the 20/20 project on our institution and the broader art community in\r\nWakefield. Curated by multidisciplinary artist Shenece Oretha during her\r\n15-month residency, the exhibition explores the intersection of sculpture and\r\nsound in modern British art.</p> <p>Oretha’s research into the sonic resonance within our collection\r\nresulted in a compelling exhibition divided into three sections: Introduction,\r\nBridge and Chorus. Each section delves into different aspects of the\r\nrelationship between sculpture and sound, offering visitors a unique sensory\r\nexperience.</p> <p>The Introduction section examined how artists including Barbara\r\nHepworth and Henry Moore were inspired by music and ancient artefacts in their\r\nsculptural practice. Through sensitive surface microphones, Oretha captured the\r\nsubtle sounds produced by interacting with sculptures, creating a multi-channel\r\nsound composition played through speaker-sculptures interspersed among the\r\nartworks. The Bridge section connected various forms and cultures, emphasising\r\nuniversal themes and inviting contemplation on shared human experiences. This\r\nsection highlighted the diverse perspectives represented in the exhibition,\r\nfostering inclusivity and dialogue.</p> <p>Supported by the UAL Decolonising Arts Institute and other\r\npartners, the 20/20 project underscores our commitment to promoting a diversity\r\nof approaches to how we display, engage and create art at the Hepworth\r\nWakefield. Oretha’s residency exemplifies this commitment, as it provided an\r\nincredible opportunity to explore our collection through a novel lens and\r\nattend to the myriad histories that are held within the objects and artworks in\r\nour care. We are grateful that Shenece Oretha’s incredible artwork has also\r\njoined our collection.</p> <p>Through workshops, discussions and collective listening\r\nsessions, Oretha encouraged visitors to engage with art on a deeper level,\r\nfostering a sense of community and connection. The exhibition served as a\r\ntestament to the enduring power of art to provoke thought, spark conversation\r\nand inspire change.</p> <p>As we reflect on the success of the 20/20 project, we are\r\ngrateful for the opportunity to be part of such a ground-breaking project. We\r\nlook forward to continuing our mission of promoting inclusivity and diversity\r\nwithin the arts and creating spaces where all voices are heard and celebrated.</p>"},"id":"b94267e7-98de-4a7c-80b5-752e5826c68c","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
