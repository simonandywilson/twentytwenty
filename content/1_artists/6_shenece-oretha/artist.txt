Through multi-vocal and multichannel installations, sculpture, print, workshops and text her work amplifies and celebrates listening and sound as an embodied and collective practice. Shenece's works are attentive to not just the music, but the musicality of Black art and life, oral and aural traditions, ceremonies and literature together with the emotional, physical and communal resonance they generate.</p>"},"id":"5e46f981-ea1f-42ba-91d2-6d379b784b16","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"image":["file://9Ag3yuCNbmk308Bf"]},"id":"0a65752f-6b4d-46c7-8aa4-ce8b6f01d6a9","isHidden":false,"type":"image"},{"content":{"text":"<p><em>Why did you apply for the 20/20 project?</em></p><p>The opportunity to develop a work, and work with a collection that speaks to the intersections of my practice, politics and culture. I applied in the hopes of having time to sit with and sound out silences whether that be in the collection itself or in the wider culture.</p><p><em>What conversations, thoughts or feelings do you hope to encourage amongst your audiences during your residency?</em></p><p>I want to encourage encounters with artworks that are more than meets the eye, that are embodied and aural experiences. Inviting the wider community throughout the residency to opportunities of mutual exchange and allowing space to shape and share moments of collective listening, communion, and commonality.</p>"},"id":"1fd1ff64-2a87-4a92-b043-27f2643d8d34","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
