Partnerreflection: [{"content":{"text":"<p>Birmingham Museums Trust</p><p>Emma McMullen, Collections Access Officer<br>Victoria Osborne, Senior Curator – Fine Art<br>Sara Wajid, Co-CEO</p><p>September 2024</p><p></p><p>Christopher Samuel is a leader and an advocate for Black and disabled representation in the arts, making change in the world through socially engaged practice. This aligns with the core vision of Birmingham Museums Trust (BMT) to be a socially purposeful museums service. After being introduced to the city’s collection, Christopher felt it was essential to create a collection of oral histories of Birmingham people who identify as Black and disabled, a group which had previously been unrepresented. As a result, we have nine new oral histories documenting the voices of local people and their experiences. In this way, the residency not only enriches the art collection through Christopher’s commission but contributes enormously to the oral and social history collections in ways that will benefit Birmingham people now and in the future.</p><p>Christopher’s project extends beyond the residency and his planned exhibition at Birmingham Museum &amp; Art Gallery in 2025. The relationships Christopher has developed with the city council’s Public Health Division, local universities and other arts organisations offer exciting possibilities for further community engagement, and he is pursuing additional funding to continue the work begun during his residency.</p><p>BMT is striving to become a more confidently anti-racist museum. The 20/20 project and Christopher’s work have been another positive source of energy and critical friendship in this work. Since the 20/20 project began, we have helped to devise and enrolled on the Museums Association’s pilot Anti-Racist Museums Programme, along with six other UK museums.</p><p>The 20/20 project has informed our thinking around future residencies and how we can better support artists in navigating the institution and its collections. Our aim is to develop a more integrated, participation-led and sustainable residency model that benefits artists, the museum and local communities. Looking ahead, we have also identified opportunities for BMT to work more closely with artists and curators in the city and help to strengthen these local and regional networks.</p><p>Working with Christopher has been inspiring and has changed us all as individuals, both professionally and personally. His residency not only highlighted and helped to address crucial gaps in the city’s historical collection relating to people with disabilities, but also raised questions around the physical accessibility of the collections, sites and procedures, including how we catalogue and interpret objects. Without Christopher’s residency, we might not have had the catalyst to investigate and develop these themes and issues further. </p><p>The Covid-19 pandemic and its aftermath created many challenges for museums like BMT. Being part of the 20/20 project has provided a vital opportunity to reinvigorate our institutional creative spirit while addressing critical gaps in the city’s collections. Christopher’s presence at BMT has been energising, inspiring us to revisit our collection and curatorial practices. By embedding brilliant artists like Christopher Samuel within the organisation, we are rediscovering the artistic potential of the broad range of the city’s collections and deepening our social impact purpose and commitment to anti-racism.</p>"},"id":"483eb4c6-244e-40d8-b0da-22f240125f31","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
