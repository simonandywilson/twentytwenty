She invited them to the Glasgow Museums Resource Centre to handle the selected objects from her research and share stories through oral storytelling, hand building clay and singing workshops. The collaborations have been an integral part of how the work developed and were a cathartic way for Arif herself to uncover the very human narratives behind these ornamental objects. </p>"},"id":"58908bb4-2cce-49a4-b21c-d84905a9f2b2","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"images":["file://yr7eWg1IZguVCDAD","file://ujFaP4HbZs4MoVMB"],"caption":"","ratio":"4/3","crop":"true"},"id":"11adf778-6fa2-456b-824f-3e8709f3d565","isHidden":false,"type":"gallery"},{"content":{"text":"<p>The performers in the film embody some of these objects that Arif found in the collection. These objects – represented in human form – revitalise rich South Asian customs and heritage, resisting their portrayal as mere souvenirs from the British Empire. Through the presence of performers, she reminds us that it was more than just the appropriation of an object and its history. The severity of the damage and confusion caused through colonialism was on a human level. By shedding light on the hidden histories, the work recontextualizes Glasgow's colonial legacy and the South Asian heritage within the British Empire.</p>"},"id":"f5c2e5ae-abb5-4be7-b9e9-02e2ae4f0e9b","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"image":["file://V1Wjx15C3lNA0VHN"]},"id":"45b17f27-139a-4d4c-8000-96ebe0b9828d","isHidden":false,"type":"image"}]

Partnerreflection: [{"content":{"text":"<p>Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum hosted Aqsa Arif for the 20/20 residency and displayed <em>Anam Ki Almari (The Trophy Cupboard)</em> and <em>Ghar Ke Khazaneh (Home Treasures)</em> (both 2023) at the museum from 2 November 2023 – 8 July 2024. We also worked with Aqsa to realise the acquisition of this work alongside other recent acquisitions for Glasgow Museums by BIPOC artists from different generations in Scotland.</p><p>Aqsa Arif’s 20/20 residency is part of broader work at Kelvingrove and wider Glasgow Museums venues as part of a commitment made by the Head of Museums and Senior Management Team to anti-racist and decolonial practices. The current programme at Kelvingrove was initiated by Miles Greenwood in 2020 and is continuing with Nelson Cummins from March 2023 in their capacity as Curator (Legacies of Empire and Slavery), alongside other colleagues. As a curatorial and museums management team we are pro-actively discussing racism, anti-racist practice, histories of empire and slavery present across our collections, and how we address this visibly in venues, databases, collecting activity and online materials. This discussion and work have not been limited to curatorial, learning and research teams. The Kelvingrove team organised briefings for front-of-house staff and shop, café, cleaning and technical staff about the display of Aqsa’s work, alongside the semi-permanent display co-curated by Our Shared Cultural Heritage Changemakers, called <em>Glasgow: City of Empire.</em>  This wider staff group is also being supported to undertake their own learning through further and ongoing professional development via tailored training and investment in a staff library.</p><p>There were some continuity challenges for Aqsa with the change of staff (both curatorial and managerial at Kelvingrove) but Aqsa navigated the difficulties and achieved this exhibition despite changing staff support and stretched museum resources within a local authority. In the original residency outline there was not a presumption that there would be a physical display. However, through the change of Museum Manager and the development of Aqsa’s work, a space was identified within the museum ensuring it could be supported and profiled in the venue and enabling the influence of the work to reach a wider audience.</p><p>In the short-term, <em>Anam Ki Almari</em> raises questions about the museum and the nearby exhibition display that inspired it. The strong decolonial, anti-racist narrative running through the film has informed other planned work on displays at Kelvingrove and other venues. The curatorial team at Kelvingrove has used Aqsa’s display, alongside <em>City of Empire</em>, to facilitate visits and discussions on anti-racist practice with internal staff groups and wider community groups and partners, with Aqsa’s display playing a key role in sparking discussions and reflections on institutional change.</p><p>As it becomes part of Glasgow Museums’ collection, the long-term ambition of the artist is for the work to continue to be a catalyst for change from within. This supports us as a museum service actively exploring how we sustain interventionist practices and use opportunities for display changes and exhibitions to expand the stories that our objects can tell with a less white, western-centric perspective.</p>"},"id":"0d160bef-8de4-4d1a-a61e-57ed6f97e849","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
