Alt: A vibrant mixed-media installation featuring five vertical fabric panels hanging side-by-side. The outer panels depict Black figures in nature scenesâ€”kneeling by plants, sitting by roots, or climbing trees. The central panel shows a powerful central figure surrounded by foliage, animals, and two circular womb-like spaces containing curled human figures. The background panels have swirling red root patterns, and coloured light projections illuminate fabric shapes on the floor, creating a dynamic, immersive scene.
