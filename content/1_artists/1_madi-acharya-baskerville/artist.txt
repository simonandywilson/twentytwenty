Partnerreflection: [{"content":{"text":"<p>When I joined Lightbox as Director in January\r\n2022, I was delighted that we were part of the 20/20 project, an initiative\r\nthat absolutely resonated with my vision for The Lightbox.</p> <p>Lightbox Gallery is at a pivotal point in its\r\nhistory. Its significant set of assets, from the Barfield-designed building to\r\nits social history (as told in the museum’s <i>Woking’s Story</i> display<sup>i</sup>)\r\nand collection (the and The Joan Hurst Sculptural Collection), provided a\r\nstrong foundation to undertake this work.</p> <p>Working with Madi Acharya-Baskerville and the\r\n20/20 project significantly supported our progress in implementing our new\r\nstrategic aims for the next three years.<sup>ii</sup> The project underpins the\r\nframework for development of our collection and forms the foundation for a new\r\ncapital application for the re-display of <i>Woking’s Story</i>, and to develop\r\nour knowledge and experience of integrating contemporary artists’ work into our\r\nongoing programmes.</p> <p>Madi\r\nAcharya-Baskerville worked with the heritage collection and community\r\ngroups at the Shah Jehan Mosque, resulting in new audience relationships\r\ncreating work inspired by the heritage collection and the artist’s own\r\npractice. Three new works by Acharya-Baskerville will\r\njoin the collection and it is our intention to build on this model<i>. I Dream\r\na Palace</i> has been an important starting point to inform our future thinking\r\nand to test how we might effectively connect with new audiences using <i>Woking’s\r\nStory</i> as inspiration, and giving it a contemporary relevance. We have expanded our peer\r\nconnections regionally and nationally, and shared our learnings through the\r\ndevelopment of this project.</p> <p>Our experience of being inaugural members of\r\nUAL’s Decolonising Collections: Curatorial Research Network (established 2021)\r\nhas resulted in rethinking how we speak about, classify and learn from our\r\ncollection, and this underpins our re-display proposal.</p> <p><i>Woking’s Story</i> is currently designed\r\naround elements uncovering the often-surprising history of Woking from its\r\npalace (the former Tudor palace) to the first purpose-built mosque in the UK\r\n(Shah Jehan Mosque). <i>Woking’s Story</i> provides a wealth of material to start new\r\nconversations and connections whether it be the rich Islamic culture of the historic\r\nmosque, mental health and well-being (Brookwood Hospital), or diving into its\r\ndesign and cultural heritage (Woking is the home of McLaren Automotive, and\r\nKenneth Wood invented his food mixer in Woking).</p> <p>This display was designed as part of\r\nLightbox’s opening in 2007 and our current challenge is how to keep it relevant\r\nto Woking’s changing demographic.<sup>iii</sup> Our project with Madi\r\nAcharya-Baskerville has re-imagined and updated the presentation of <i>Woking’s\r\nStory</i>, initially through a series of new displays, co-curated with the\r\ncontemporary voices of artists and audiences representative of today’s\r\ncommunities in Woking’s locality.</p> <p>This valuable research and development will feed into our\r\nstrategic and future thinking on the re-display of heritage collections and\r\ncontemporary displays. As we have joined the Contemporary Art Society as Museum\r\nMembers, this period of research and development will additionally inform our\r\nfuture acquisition policy for social history and contemporary art.</p>"},"id":"d77db1cc-439f-4b36-b36d-c7a262292666","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
