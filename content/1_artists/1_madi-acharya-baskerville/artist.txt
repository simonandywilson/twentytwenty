Partnerreflection: [{"content":{"text":"<p>Lightbox Gallery, Woking</p><p>Sarah Brown, Director</p><p>March 2024</p><p></p><p>When I joined Lightbox as Director in January 2022, I was delighted that we were part of the 20/20 project, an initiative that absolutely resonated with my vision for The Lightbox.</p><p>Lightbox Gallery is at a pivotal point in its history. Its significant set of assets, from the Barfield-designed building to its social history (as told in the museum’s <em>Woking’s Story</em> displayi) and collection (the and The Joan Hurst Sculptural Collection), provided a strong foundation to undertake this work.</p><p>Working with Madi Acharya-Baskerville and the 20/20 project significantly supported our progress in implementing our new strategic aims for the next three years.ii The project underpins the framework for development of our collection and forms the foundation for a new capital application for the re-display of <em>Woking’s Story</em>, and to develop our knowledge and experience of integrating contemporary artists’ work into our ongoing programmes.</p><p>Madi Acharya-Baskerville worked with the heritage collection and community groups at the Shah Jehan Mosque, resulting in new audience relationships creating work inspired by the heritage collection and the artist’s own practice. Three new works by Acharya-Baskerville will join the collection and it is our intention to build on this model<em>. I Dream a Palace</em> has been an important starting point to inform our future thinking and to test how we might effectively connect with new audiences using <em>Woking’s Story</em> as inspiration, and giving it a contemporary relevance. We have expanded our peer connections regionally and nationally, and shared our learnings through the development of this project.</p><p>Our experience of being inaugural members of UAL’s Decolonising Collections: Curatorial Research Network (established 2021) has resulted in rethinking how we speak about, classify and learn from our collection, and this underpins our re-display proposal.</p><p><em>Woking’s Story</em> is currently designed around elements uncovering the often-surprising history of Woking from its palace (the former Tudor palace) to the first purpose-built mosque in the UK (Shah Jehan Mosque). <em>Woking’s Story</em> provides a wealth of material to start new conversations and connections whether it be the rich Islamic culture of the historic mosque, mental health and well-being (Brookwood Hospital), or diving into its design and cultural heritage (Woking is the home of McLaren Automotive, and Kenneth Wood invented his food mixer in Woking).</p><p>This display was designed as part of Lightbox’s opening in 2007 and our current challenge is how to keep it relevant to Woking’s changing demographic.iii Our project with Madi Acharya-Baskerville has re-imagined and updated the presentation of <em>Woking’s Story</em>, initially through a series of new displays, co-curated with the contemporary voices of artists and audiences representative of today’s communities in Woking’s locality.</p><p>This valuable research and development will feed into our strategic and future thinking on the re-display of heritage collections and contemporary displays. As we have joined the Contemporary Art Society as Museum Members, this period of research and development will additionally inform our future acquisition policy for social history and contemporary art.</p>"},"id":"d77db1cc-439f-4b36-b36d-c7a262292666","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
