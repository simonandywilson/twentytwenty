Partnerreflection: [{"content":{"text":"<p>The National Disability Art\r\nCollection and Archive (NDACA) is an archival collection looking at how art\r\nmade by disabled people reflected, recorded and was inspired by the struggle\r\nfor disability rights in the UK. From the outset, we were lucky that\r\ninclusivity was a major driver of this twentieth- and twenty-first-century\r\nrights struggle and serves to partially to insulate the collection from charges\r\nof overt racial (or other forms of) prejudice or exclusion.</p> <p>The majority of work held\r\nin NDACA dates from the 1990s when Disabled people agitated for fundamental\r\ncivil rights and social change through the adoption of the social model of\r\ndisability. This era of activism and the people who agitated for it were primarily\r\nconcerned with physical impairment.</p> <p>The greatest challenge\r\nfacing the collection has been to come to terms with and address the\r\nspecificities of particular time periods, including the focuses of the rights\r\nmovement and which disabled artists were working in parallel at the time. NDACA\r\nrequires a collection expansion that fully acknowledges the cultural\r\ncontribution of neuro-divergent artists and artists with learning difficulties.\r\nBoth groups are under-represented in our collections.</p> <p>This project made me aware\r\nthat our catalogue, while trying to avoid the outdated medical model (where\r\ndisability is defined and caused by an individual condition) uses descriptive\r\nlanguage that makes it hard to identify neuro-divergent artists. It also lacks\r\n‘easy read’ descriptions that can make collections more accessible for people\r\nwith learning difficulties. The catalogue will be revised accordingly,\r\nincluding asking more artists to describe their own work.</p> <p>The catalogue’s choice of\r\nsuitable descriptive language will also need to change over time to reflect\r\ndevelopment in the social and cultural status of disabled people. Sourcing this\r\nterminology will require an engagement with disabled audiences to ensure that\r\nthe demand ‘nothing about us without us’ is always met.</p> <p>Visiting the collection is\r\nmade accessible by using a website as an initial point of contact. However,\r\nbeing part of this project has made me reassess our visitor facilities.\r\nBarriers to access can deter potential visitors as effectively as lack of recognition\r\nwithin a collection.</p> <p>Engagement between NDACA\r\nand a new user, whether an artistic practitioner or ‘ordinary’ visitor, often\r\nresults in the discovery of new areas of interest or ways of working. When that\r\nengagement has at its heart an artistic survey and reflection of the whole\r\ncollection, the resulting provocations carry extra weight that can complement\r\nexisting change and suggest new pathways.</p> <p>The 1990s focus of the\r\nNDACA ‘starter’ collection resulted in a situation where some groups are\r\nunder-represented as artists or subjects. The collection does not reflect the\r\ndiversity of disabled people. Working with the NDACA acquisitions group (which\r\nbetter reflects this diversity), we have rewritten the collections and\r\nacquisitions strategy to address this under-representation and to locate more\r\ndiverse work. Jamila Prowse’s created work is part of that process.</p> <p>We are widening our\r\ncollecting focus. Recent work by the acquisitions group has sought to identify\r\ncommunities of disabled people that are poorly represented in the collection,\r\neither by their genuine absence, or a presence in archival assets still to be\r\ncatalogued and digitised.</p> <p>Participation in the 20/20\r\nproject has served to highlight the importance of recognising the combinations\r\n(and, in some cases, contradictions) around issues of intersectionality when\r\nattempting to make collections that truly reflect the diversity of the society,\r\nculture and experiences. NDACA welcomes the opportunity to widen its viewpoint,\r\nconcerns and audiences.</p> <p>From now on, we will make\r\nfurther efforts to hear their voices; source their work and interpretations;\r\nand exhibit to them.</p>"},"id":"c4e80016-a315-4813-9d4a-ecbd413a6980","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
