Hajallie looks to champion figures from ethnically diverse backgrounds that have conspicuously been omitted from traditional British portraiture. Through the exploration of identity within his ballpoint pen portraits; he looks to confront socio-political issues apropos to the perception of various demographics as being of lesser human value. Specifically, with minority groups often being further marginalised by mainstream media, reflecting an archaic hierarchy of status emblematic of colonial ideologies. </p>"},"id":"86a105f4-e1e1-4043-9e38-9f46bf80d461","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["file://epECJg9mI6R7IlIv"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"‘The Large Collectors’, work in progress","link":"","ratio":"","crop":"false"},"id":"b3d3145e-fa07-48ba-a8d7-e3e978282633","isHidden":false,"type":"image"},{"content":{"text":"<p>Hajallie strives to rectify the historic lack of visibility of figures from ethnic minority backgrounds. Therefore, questioning preconceived notions regarding what it means to be quintessentially British, as well as the uncomfortable nuances that are associated with this, is imperative for the artist. Though born in Southeast London, his drawings are often Informed by his Sierra Leonean and Lebanese heritage. By calling upon anecdotal references to portray scenes that are occasionally quasi-surrealist representations; the drawings look to confront lingering ethnocentrisms that are still embedded within modern western society. </p><p>Using antique texts &amp; maps as canvases enables Hajallie to pragmatically re-contextualise ephemera, creating a cohesion between the concepts informing the work and the figures he depicts. As he empowers various figures; he simultaneously does so with the ground used, presenting them within new contexts. Placing himself or family members as the subjects of my portraits evokes a sense of immediacy, apropos to navigating the intersection of his western upbringing and familial West African culture.</p><p>Specialising in the use of a monochrome medium such as the black ballpoint pen to celebrate Blackness, allows Hajallie to somewhat paradoxically, show that there is more to an individual than just the colour of their skin.  He builds layers of tone with delicate mark making methods through precise strokes of the everyday ballpoint pen  as he looks to celebrate authentic drawing within the digital age. </p><p>Hajallie depicts motifs that challenge largely accepted revisionist narratives apropos to West African Histories, with semblances of antiquated ideologies at the root of nuanced prejudices that he has experienced. Ultimately, the work looks to catalyse a discourse and embolden individuals that feel as though they have been labelled as the ‘other’ in any manifestation.</p>"},"id":"5df30f87-0331-4aca-b537-878ce6fdb19b","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
